        <p>Hello! My name is George Adams and I am from Tucson, Az. Here is a picture of the best
            stick that we found while on vacation in Alaska, it might seem silly but my 7yo was
            extremely excited! My family and I enjoy playing Dungeons & Dragons in our spare time. I
            currently work in a laboratory that processes blood and blood products. I am excited to
            be studying Software Development and can't wait to see what lay ahead!</p>
